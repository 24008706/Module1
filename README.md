Conditional Statements in Python: Even or Odd Checker
## Aim
To write a Python program to check whether the given number is even or odd using if...else statements.

## Algorithm
Get an input from the user.
Convert the input to an integer and store it in a variable a.
Use the modulo operator % to check if a % 2 == 0.
If true, print "EVEN".
Else, print "ODD".
End the program.
## Program
```
a=int(input())
if(a%2==0):
    print("EVEN")
else:
    print("ODD")
```

## Result
Thus the program executed successfully.

Ex 1:Datatypes-Boolean Expression Evaluation in Python
## Aim
To write a Python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving True and False.

## Algorithm
Set variable a to the result of the expression 0 == True.
Set variable b to the result of the expression False == False.
Set variable c to the result of the expression True + True.
Set variable d to the result of the expression False + 9.
Print the value of a with the label "a is".
Print the value of b with the label "b is".
Print the value of c with the label "c:".
Print the value of d with the label "d:".
## Program
```
a = (0 == True)      
b = (False == False)
c = True + True     
d = False + 9        

print("a is", a)     
print("b is", b)     
print("c:", c)       
print("d:", d)       

```
## output

## Result
Thus the program executed successfully.

Datatypes-Character Literal in Python
## Aim
To write a Python program that prints the characters 'T' and 'a' using character literals.

## Algorithm
Print the character 'T'.
Print the character 'a'.
## Program
```
char1 = 'T'
char2 = 'a'
print(char1)
print(char2)
```
## output
<img width="936" height="145" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a67bf65-de30-4a0b-b577-5d4f4d803421" />
Result
Thus the program executed successfully.

🧮 Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python
## Aim
To write a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts.

## Algorithm
Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable a (real part).
Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable b (imaginary part).
Create a complex number x using the complex(a, b) function.
Print the complex number x.
Print the real part of x using x.real.
Print the imaginary part of x using x.imag.
## Program
```
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
x=complex(a,b)
print(x)
print(x.real)
print(x.imag)
```
## output
<img width="968" height="192" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7af7298b-3b11-4b00-9efc-08e193c734cc" />
## Result
Thus the program executed successfully.

Datatypes-Read and Print a String in Python
## Aim
To write a Python program to read a string from the user and then print it.

## Algorithm
Assign a variable named men_stepped_on_the_moon.
Use input() to read a string from the user and store it in the variable.
Print the value stored in the variable.
## program
```
men_stepped_on_the_moon=input()
print(men_stepped_on_the_moon)
```
## output
<img width="1027" height="130" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c69fefe-dce5-444a-b2bd-99a2d491959b" />
## Result
Thus the program executed successfully.
